# Intelligent-Traffic-Agent 🚦

An intelligent agent designed to optimize traffic signal control in a simulated urban environment using the **Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO)** platform. The goal? 🚗💨 **Reduce traffic congestion, improve flow efficiency, and adapt to dynamic traffic patterns seamlessly!**

---

## 🌍 **Simulation Environment**

### 🔧 **Platform**
- **SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility):** Open-source software that simulates realistic traffic flow.

### 🛣️ **Urban Network**
- A synthetic city road network featuring:
  - Multiple intersections.
  - Various road segments.
  - Complex traffic dynamics.

### 🚘 **Traffic Demand**
- Realistic scenarios including:
  - Rush hours and heavy traffic surges.
  - Random events like road closures and accidents.

## 🧠 **Intelligent Agent Design**

### **PEAS Framework** 📊

1. **🛠️ Performance Measures:**
   - Minimize **average travel time** and **waiting time** at intersections.
   - Reduce **traffic congestion** and **queue lengths**.
   - Balance traffic flow across the entire network.

2. **🌆 Environment:**
   - Dynamic urban traffic network simulated in SUMO.
   - Includes intersections, roads, and real-time traffic flows.

3. **🔁 Actuators:**
   - Control **traffic signal durations** dynamically.
   - Implement **adaptive signal control strategies**.

4. **📡 Sensors:**
   - Collect real-time data: vehicle counts, speeds, queue lengths, and waiting times.
   - Detect anomalies like surges or road incidents.

---

### 🤔 **How Does It Work?**

#### 🔧 **Rule-Based System** (Starting Point):
- Predefined signal control rules (e.g., fixed-time strategies).

#### 🧠 **Adaptive Control**:
- Algorithms that adjust signal timings based on real-time conditions:
  - Threshold-based adjustments.
  - State-machine logic for dynamic responses.

#### 🚀 **Future Enhancements**:
- Integrate **machine learning** techniques like reinforcement learning to help the agent learn and optimize over time.

## 🛠️ **Simulation Scenarios**

1. **Traffic Volume Variations:**
   - Simulate scenarios like peak hours, calm periods, and sudden traffic spikes.

2. **🎲 Random Events:**
   - Handle challenges like accidents, road closures, or unpredictable traffic surges.

3. **🌧️ Environmental Factors (Future):**
   - Account for weather impacts like rain or fog on traffic flow.
